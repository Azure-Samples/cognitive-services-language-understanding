# Get LUIS region from app ID and subscription key
This .Net Core C# Console app demonstrates how, given a LUIS app ID and a LUIS subscription key, return the correct region for the published app.

Open the solution file in Visual Studio, change the LUIS app ID and LUIS subscription key, then build and run. The console will output the single region associated with this app. The regions that are not included show up in the `Output` window as a 401.
